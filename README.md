# 100 Days CSS Challenge Chingu Solo Project

## Overview

The goals of the project was to clone a [100 Days CSS Challenge](https://100dayscss.com/), only the desktop version, only using HTML/CSS and vanilla JS.

## Feattures

- Use of vanilla JS to create a timer function that countdown from 5 PM to the next 5 PM, giving you a 24 hours to finish a task before moving to the next day. "Moving to next day" feature is not working, but the timer will restart once you get down to 00:00:00 countdown.
- Capability to switch Days. I have two codepens for two different days. Clicking on the "Switch Day" will switch the code pen.
- Flexbox is used with the design
- font used is monoscope
